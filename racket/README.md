### Goal
Try to speedrun this book until Chapter 5 since


> Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler in **Chapter 5**. The substitution model is only the first of these modelsâ€”a way to get started thinking formally about the evaluation process. In general, when modeling phenomena in science and engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models.

> As we examine things in greater detail, these simple models become inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models. The substitution model is no exception. In particular, when we address in **Chapter 3** the use of procedures with *mutable data*, we will see that the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by a more complicated model of procedure application.
