    "The `good-enough?` test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alternative strategy for implementing `good-enough?` is to watch how `guess` changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the `guess`. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large numbers?\n",

    "In *numerical analysis*, the **Newton–Raphson method**, also known simply as **Newton's method**, named after *Isaac Newton* and *Joseph Raphson*, is a *root-finding algorithm* which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a *real-valued function*. The most basic version starts with a *real-valued function* $f$, its derivative $f'$, and an initial guess $x_0$ for a root of $f$. If $f$ satisfies certain assumptions and the initial guess is close, then:\n",

    "is a better approximation of the root than $x_0$. Geometrically, $(x_1, 0)$ is the *x-intercept* of the *tangent* of the graph of $f$ at $(x_0, f(x_0))$: that is, the improved guess, $x_1$, is the unique root of the *linear approximation* of $f$ at the initial guess, $x_0$. The process is repeated as:\n",

This algorithm is first in the class of *Householder's methods*, and was succeeded by *Halley's method*. The method can also be extended to *complex functions* and to *systems of equations*.\n",
